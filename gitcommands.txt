This is a record of regularly used git commands

# To create a new local git:
	git init "FOLDER"
   Then create a git rep in your git hub account 

# To sync the online copy with the real copy:
	git remote add origin git@github.com:kendokendo/"FOLDER"
	git push -u origin master

# After creating a file, if you want to upload it to you rep:
	git add "FILENAME"
   This tells git the file is ready to be written to the rep, but does not write it to the rep

# To write a file to the rep:
	git commit
   This will write all the files that were "added". It will first open up a text editor (nano) and reuqest a change be made to the log.

# To write a file to the rep without making having to open the log:
	git commit -m "Enter change log or fix here"

# To write add all the files in the folder & commit them: 
	git commit -a

# To push all the files to git hub:
	git push
   This will update your online rep.  This will permanently remove the current file on the online git with whatever you tell it to. 

# If you've lost track of the files you've committed to:
	git status 

# To track the changes to a particular file
	git diff "FILENAME"
   git diff without the filename will look at the entire folder and list the differences between the files in your folder
   and the files that were committed.  It does not look at the online git rep.
