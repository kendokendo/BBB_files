This is a record of regularly used git commands

# To create a new local git
	git init "FOLDER"
   Then create a git rep in your git hub account 

# To sync the online copy with the real copy
	git remote add origin git@github.com:kendokendo/"FOLDER"
	git push -u origin master

# After creating a file, if you want to upload it to you rep:
	git add "FILENAME"
   This tells git the file is ready to be written to the rep, but does not write it to the rep

# To write a file to the rep:
	git commit
   This will write all the files that were "added". It will first open up a text editor (nano) and reuqest a change be made to the log.

# To write a file to the rep without making having to open the log:
	git commit -m "Enter change log or fix here"

# To write add all the files in the folder & commit them: 
	git commit -a

# To push all the files to git hub:
	git push
   This will update your online rep.  This will permanently remove the current file on the online git with whatever you tell it to.
